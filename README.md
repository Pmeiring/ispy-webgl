## Frequently asked questions

### How do I run this application locally?

Clone this repository and in the `ispy-webgl/` run either `python -m http.server` (python3) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (python2.7). Then go to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### How do I hide/show objects like jets?

Objects like particle flow jets can be hidden by hovering over them in the display (and the color will change to gray). Press `H` to hide the jet. Press `S` to show.
Note that the hidden objects are put in a list so hide and show are push and pop actions, respectively.

### Does this run on a touch-screen like a tablet or phone?

Yes, it should. You will not have access to certain click events though.

### I've gotten the view into a "weird" state where I've lost sight of everything (so to speak). How do I recover?

You can either press the "Home" button to return to the original view or simply refresh the page and start again.

### How do I produce files for events I want to view?

More information is [here](https://github.com/cms-outreach/ispy-analyzers).

### How do I change to colors of the objects in the display?

### How do I select events based on cuts?

### How do I make a nice publication-quality event display?
